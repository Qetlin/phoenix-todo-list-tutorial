Hi!

Welcome to dwyl! Thanks so much for your interest, we're excited to have you!

At dwyl we work to help you do what you love (whether you know what that is yet or not). We do this through technology and we hold certain beliefs strongly, including that *your data belongs to you* and no one else. You can see those here: href="https://github.com/ideaq/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md

As we develop dwyl, you'll be the first to hear of the progress and the first to use the app.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please reply to this email or add an issue to github here (if that's your kind of thing): https://github.com/dwyl/time/labels/MVP
We really appreciate it!

Happy dwyling,
Ines & Nelson
