<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Welcome to dwyl! Thanks so much for your interest, we're excited to have you!</p>

<p>At dwyl we work to help you do what you love (whether you know what that is yet or not). We do this through technology and we <a href="https://github.com/ideaq/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md">hold certain beliefs strongly</a>, including that <strong>your data belongs to you</strong> and no one else.</p>

<p>As we develop dwyl over the summer, you'll be the first to hear of the progress and the first to use the app.</a>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, please reply to this email or <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/time/labels/MVP">add an issue to github</a> (if that's your kind of thing), we <i>really appreciate</i> it!</p>

<p>Happy dwyling!</p>
Ines & Nelson
